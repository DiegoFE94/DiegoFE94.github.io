I am delighted to announce that I have started a new contract as a research support technician in the European project ***"RePo-SUDOE: Drug Repurposing for Effective and Accelerated Drug Development in the SUDOE Space"***. See more information below.

The RePo-SUDOE project seeks to develop and disseminate technologies for drug repurposing with the aim of increasing the competitiveness of the SUDOE space in this area of R & D, promoting the biopharmaceutical industry and capturing trained human resources. This objective will be achieved through 3 specific objectives:

<ul>
    <li>Promote scientific knowledge and disseminate drug repurposing technology together with public and private actors, raising the groups and R & D centers of the SUDOE space to the level of European excellence in this area of R & D.</li>
    <li>Enhance multidisciplinary collaboration and identify opportunities and innovative initiatives in the SUDOE territory for drug repurposing, through the implementation of a transnational network. A database with information on therapeutic targets and drugs with biological activity will be created. As the main case study, drug repurposing methodologies will be developed for the treatment of cancer.</li>
    <li>Create a three-dimensional (3D) display room prototype of biological systems, which will function as a pilot in the SUDOE territory. It will be a space with virtual reality technology and augmented reality that allows the 3D visualisation of therapeutic objectives and their interaction with drugs, in an interactive and pedagogical way, dedicated to young students and researchers from STEAM areas.</li>
</ul>

This project brings together, for the first time, partners from different SUDOE regions and different areas of the drug development value chain, in a common drug repurposing project. The RePo-SUDOE will put at the service of the scientific information society of easy consultation and open access, and decisive visualisation technologies for the affirmation of the area of drug repurposing in the SUDOE space.
